Image of Rowling Login Page:

Background: A subtle, blurred image of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at dusk, with a warm light emanating from the windows.

Header:

A simple and elegant logo depicting a golden snitch with wings outstretched, positioned in the center.
The text "Rowling" written in a font resembling ancient magical script, positioned below the logo.
Main Content:

A title "Welcome to Rowling!" in a warm and friendly font that resembles handwritten parchment, positioned in the center.
Below the title, a login form with rounded corners, styled to resemble a weathered potion bottle with a cork stopper at the top.
Two input fields inside the form:
The top field labeled "Username/Elixir" with a placeholder text "Enter your username".
The bottom field labeled "Password/Parseltongue" with a placeholder text "Enter your password". Both fields have a subtle wand icon next to them.
A golden key labeled "Unleash the Magic" positioned below the form, resembling the key to Professor Dumbledore's office.
Below the key, two smaller links written in a smaller font resembling handwritten parchment:
"Forgotten your wand?" on the left.
"New wizard? Register here" on the right.
Additional details:

Consider adding a subtle smoke or magical particle effect around the potion bottle and the golden key.
The overall color scheme should be warm and inviting, with a mix of brown, gold, and soft blues.
I hope this detailed description helps you visualize and create the login page image for your website.
